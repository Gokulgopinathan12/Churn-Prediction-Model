# Churn-Prediction-Model
The Churn Prediction Model project aims to develop a predictive model using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to forecast customer churn in business contexts.

Objective:
This project seeks to uncover patterns in historical customer data and build a model that predicts customer churn. The goal is to empower businesses with actionable insights to retain customers at risk of churning.

Methodology:
Through EDA techniques, the project explores and visualizes key factors influencing churn. Machine learning algorithms are then employed to develop a predictive model based on the identified insights.

Expected Outcome:
The project's outcome includes a robust churn prediction model that enables proactive customer retention strategies, ensuring sustained growth and profitability for businesses.
